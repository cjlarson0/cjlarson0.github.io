Hello!

My Name is Connor Larson and I am a data enthusiast trying to work my way up in the world of data analytics and data science. Right now my skills consist of a grab bag of data engineering, data analysis, and some data science. I am currently an Analytics Engineer at Dematic North America and studying to get a Masters in Data Science and Analyics at Grand Valley State University. 

I am a proud Michigan Wolverine and college football, basketball, and hockey fan. Detroit sports fan. Snowboarder. Fisherman. Outdoorsman.
